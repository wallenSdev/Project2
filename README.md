# Project2

*Problem Statement:*
Many home cooks often struggle with the dilemma of what to cook based on the ingredients they have in their kitchen. It can be challenging to come up with recipes using the available ingredients, leading to food waste and uninspired meals. A recipe tracker application aims to address this issue by providing users with a platform to log the ingredients they have in their fridge, suggesting recipes based on those ingredients, and allowing users to save and organize their favorite recipes for future use.
*Acceptance Criteria:*
1. *User Authentication:*
   - Users should be able to create an account and log in using their email and password.
2. *Ingredient Logging:*
   - Users can log ingredients they have in their kitchen, specifying the ingredient name.
   - Users can edit or remove ingredients from their kitchen to get different recipe results.
3. *Recipe Suggestions:*
   - The application should analyze the ingredients in the user's fridge and suggest recipes that can be prepared using those ingredients.
   - The suggested recipes should prioritize the use of ingredients the user already has.
   - Users can view multiple recipe suggestions based on their available ingredients.
   - Users can filter recipe suggestions based on dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free) or cooking time.
4. *Saving and Organizing Recipes:*
   - Users can save recipes they like
   - Users can create multiple groups of saved recipes for different occasions or preferences.
   - Users can edit or remove saved recipes from their collection.
5. *API Integration for Ingredient Details:*
   - The application should integrate with an external API to fetch additional details about ingredients, such as macronutrient information (macros) and approximate prices.
   - Users can view the macros and prices of ingredients listed in their input.
6. *User Interface:*
   - The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to log ingredients, view recipe suggestions, and manage their saved recipes efficiently.
   - User data, including login credentials and ingredient lists, should be securely stored
By meeting these acceptance criteria, the recipe tracker application ensures a seamless and efficient user experience, helping users create delicious and resourceful meals based on the ingredients they have readily available.
